## **File naming conventions 📁**

- There are main three folders ```data```, ```scripts```, ```notebooks```
- You get the datafiles with the issue so just add the data set under the folder ```data``` -> ``` dataset-<#issue number>``` -> ```file.csv``` or any other types of data there can be multiple data files also
-  ```data``` -> ```dataset-<#issue number>```  also make one ```README.md``` in which explain about the dataset
-  next
-  if you want any preprocessing or any kind of scripts then add a folder in the folder ``` scripts/``` name it ``` issue-<#issue-number>``` and add all the scripts that you created
-  if possible add the README.md file in the folder ``` scripts/issue-<#issue-number>``` which you created in the upper step and explain what your script is doing
-  after
-  make a folder in the ``` notebooks/ ``` name it ``` issue-<#issue-number>``` and add your data analysis or task you have into it and if possible add accuracy about the issue solved
